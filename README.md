# ChatBot

*A lab report by Christine Ku*


## Make the ChatBot your own

I changed a few things:
*  The first thing I changed was the topic of discussion. I made it a Who Am I? guessing game for the user to interact with.
*  I added a gif onto the webpage. I was going to add more, but DOM did not work for me to modify the css and html files dynamically.
*  I changed the font type and the color of the webpage in the css file.

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot
